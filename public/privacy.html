            <h2>Your Rights as a Data Subject</h2>
            <p>You can exercise the following rights at any time using the contact details of our data protection officer:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Information about your data stored with us and its processing,</li>
            <li>Correction of incorrect personal data,</li>
            <li>Deletion of your data stored with us,</li>
            <li>Restriction of data processing, if we are not yet allowed to delete your data due to legal obligations,</li>
            <li>Objection to the processing of your data by us, and</li>
            <li>Data portability, if you have consented to data processing or have concluded a contract with us.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have given us your consent, you can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.</p>
            <p>You can always lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority responsible for you. The responsible supervisory authority depends on your state of residence, your workplace, or the alleged violation. A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with addresses can be found at: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p>
            <h2>Purposes of Data Processing by the Responsible Party and Third Parties</h2>
            <p>We process your personal data only for the purposes stated in this privacy policy. Your personal data will not be transferred to third parties for purposes other than those mentioned. We only share your personal data with third parties if:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>You have given your explicit consent,</li>
            <li>the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract with you,</li>
            <li>the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>the processing is necessary to protect legitimate interests and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest worthy of protection in not disclosing your data.</p>
            <h2>Deletion or Blocking of Data</h2>
            <p>We adhere to the principles of data minimization and data avoidance. We therefore store your personal data only as long as is necessary to achieve the purposes mentioned here or as provided for by the various storage periods stipulated by law. After the respective purpose ceases to apply or these periods expire, the corresponding data is routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>
            <h2>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h2>

This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and similar information. This is exclusively information that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your person.</p>
            <p>This information is technically necessary to correctly deliver the content of websites requested by you and is mandatory when using the Internet. In particular, it is processed for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ensuring a smooth connection to the website,</li>
            <li>Ensuring smooth use of our website,</li>
            <li>Evaluation of system security and stability, and</li>
            <li>for other administrative purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The processing of your personal data is based on our legitimate interest from the aforementioned purposes for data collection. We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Recipients of the data are only the responsible party and, if applicable, processors.</p>
            <p>Anonymous information of this kind may be statistically evaluated by us in order to optimize our website and the underlying technology.</p>
            <h2>SSL Encryption</h2>
            <p>To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption methods (e.g., SSL) via HTTPS.</p>
            <h2><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to adapt this privacy policy so that it always complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the privacy policy, e.g., when introducing new services. The new privacy policy will apply to your next visit.</p>
